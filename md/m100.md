# M100

The M100 data are all taken from existing (but old) ALMA data
described in https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3_Combine_5.4

Given that the TP data are available in a 5 km/s binned version, we also
make the MS data available in this gridding, which brings the file sizes
substantially down, and good for experiments. The **M100_trimdata** script
prepares the


## Imaging

The following imaging parameters should make it possible to compare maps pixel by pixel
without the need for regridding:

      phasecenter  = 'J2000 12h22m54.9 +15d49m15'
      imsize       = 800
      cell         = '0.5arcsec'

this is for ALMA configurations where the resulting beam is about 4.4 x 2.9".

For detailed comparisons we use a smaller box, excluding fairly obvious edge effects. The box
is also designed to allow comparison of channel based total fluxes with the BIMA SONG data.

      box1  = '219,148,612,579'     # casaguide box in their 800x800 image; flux is 3118
      box2  = '252,182,574,524'     # a better box?                   But flux only 2569

Although 70 channels are available, there are mysterious blanked end-channels (both first and last),
so the safe thing would be to prepare comparison cubes excluding the first and last channel.
