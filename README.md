# Scripts for the Paper

These should be the steps that allow you to reproduce the
figures in the paper:

1. Ensure your CASA has **astropy** installed
2. Ensure the **analysisUtilities** are installed for your CASA
3. Run configure to be able to run the CASA based scripts
4. Gather the data (see ../data/README_DC2019_data)
5. Execfile DC_script.py to run through your selected data set


   
## 1. - 3. Preparations
Details are given in [Preparation](https://github.com/teuben/dc2019/blob/master/scripts4paper/Preparation.md)
You have to make these adjustments just once.


## 4. Data

Details are in [../data/README_DC2019_data](../data/README_DC2019_data)

This suggests that the data is present in **../data**, physically or via
a symlink.


## 5. DC_script.py, DC_run.py, and IQA_script.py

At each start of a CASA instance you have to call the **DC_locals.py** once to set up your source and destination folders, e.g.

    execfile("/home/teuben/dc2019/scripts4paper/DC_locals.py",globals())

**DC_script.py** is a wrapper that calls the **DC_pars**-file you defined in there and then the combination program **DC_run.py**.

Alternatively, you can call

	execfile("/home/teuben/dc2019/scripts4paper/DC_pars_M100.py", globals()) 
	execfile("/home/teuben/dc2019/scripts4paper/DC_run.py",globals())

An overview of the capabilities of **DC_run.py** is given in [Overview](Overview.md) 
and in more detail in [DC_run](DC_run.md).
A quick start guide is given in	[Quick_start](Quick_start.md).

**DC_run.py** uses the python module **datacomb.py** for preparation and combination 
of the data and the python module **IQA_script.py** for the assessment of the combination products. 
Both modules can be used as a stand-alone.









## whaaat is this about ???

This is a discussion how the DC2019 data should be circulated, and
easily match a CASA tasks API for the different combination techniques
discussed in the paper




## Methods teams

Each method team should provide the way how the data teams should be calling that method:

   * feather - 
   * tp2vis - experimenting with CASA 6
   * sdint - upcoming in CASA 5.7
   * faridani (?) - is also in QAC
   * hybrid (?) - not really easily available, but a promising option

## Data teams

The data will be prepared in a form ready for the different methods API's:

   * M100 (line)
   * Lupus (line)
        - Line data (from workshop) here: https://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/tp2vis/Lup3mms_12CO_tp_7m_12m_nchan10.tgz
        - Images (preliminary combination): https://astrocloud.nrao.edu/s/Np7STzGMMY9fCWz
        - Adele's script here: https://github.com/teuben/dc2019/blob/master/scripts/datacomb2019_outflowsWG.py
   * HI (line)
   * N346(line)
   * skymodel (cont)
        - Script for imaging the individual simulated datasets by Dirk Petry using the hogbom deconvolver https://github.com/teuben/dc2019/blob/master/scripts4paper/scriptForImaging.py
   * ...

The final data will NOT be in github, we will use the UMD ftp server for this. Contact peter to provide
a link so we can make it available to others. Currently this is 
https://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/DC2019/scripts4paper/
but that name may change.
